# JavaScript Asynchronous Programming and Callbacks
## Asynchronicity in Programming Languages
*Computers are asynchronous by design.*

*Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.*

*In the current consumer computers, every program runs for a specific time slot and then it stops its execution to let another program continue their execution. This thing runs in a cycle so fast that it's impossible to notice. We think our computers run many programs simultaneously, but this is an illusion (except on multiprocessor machines).*

*Programs internally use interrupts, a signal that's emitted to the processor to gain the attention of the system.*

*Let's not go into the internals of this now, but just keep in mind that it's normal for programs to be asynchronous and halt their execution until they need attention, allowing the computer to execute other things in the meantime. When a program is waiting for a response from the network, it cannot halt the processor until the request finishes.*

*Normally, programming languages are synchronous and some provide a way to manage asynchronicity in the language or through libraries. C, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Ruby, Swift, and Python are all synchronous by default. Some of them handle async operations by using threads, spawning a new process.*
